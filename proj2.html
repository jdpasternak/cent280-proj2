<p>
        For this project, you will modify a GUI
        program that can connect to a PostgreSQL database.
        The existing GUI program, "query_db2.py" can be downloaded
        from this <a href="query_db2.py" target="_blank">link</a>. This program can
        connect to a PostgreSQL database and perform select
        queries on the data. The results of the
        select queries are displayed in a QTableWidget. The
        functionality is broken up into two tabs. The
        first tab allows the user to set the
        database connection information. The second tab is where
        the select queries are performed.
      </p>
<p>
        Your task will be to add to this
        program so that SQL scripts can be run
        on a database. These could be scripts that
        consist of SQL commands or scripts that create
        plpgsql functions. Since plpgsql functions contain more than
        just SQL commands, the best way to parse
        these files is to make use of <b>psql</b>.
        This means that your program will run <b>psql</b>
        inside a <b>subprocess</b>.
      </p>
<p>
        If we were going to run psql from
        within a Python console program, it would be
        relatively straightforward to accomplish this. Here is a
        simple program that shows how this could be
        done:
      </p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line=""><code class="language-python">
import subprocess

commands = ["psql","-U","bob","-W","proj2_db"]
subprocess.run(commands,stdin=open("auth_funcs.sql"))</code></pre>
<p>
        This will execute the following command:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-markup" style="font-family: Anonymous Pro;font-size: 85%;">
psql -U bob -W proj2_db &lt; auth_funcs.sql</code></pre>
<p>
        If you were to run such a program,
        you would be prompted for the password. Since
        this is a console-based program, you would just
        type in the password at the prompt in
        the console.
      </p>
<p>
        Responding to a console prompt is not something
        that is done in a GUI program. To
        get around having to respond to the prompt
        for a password, we need to do two
        things. The first, is to create a file
        called <b>.pgpass</b> in the Linux user's home directory.
        The contents of that file would be in
        the following format:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-markup" style="font-family: Anonymous Pro;font-size: 85%;">
host:port:dbname:username:password</code></pre>
<p>
        For the proj2_db database, these values would be:
      </p>
<pre><code class="language-markup" style="font-family: Anonymous Pro;font-size: 85%;">
localhost:5432:proj2_db:bob:somepass</code></pre>
<p>
        The second thing that would have to be
        done would to remove the <b>-W</b> switch from
        the psql command. If we saved the above
        values inside <b>~/.pgpass</b>, then the following modified program
        would work without having to respond to a
        prompt:
      </p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line=""><code class="language-python">
import subprocess

commands = ["psql","-U","bob","proj2_db"]
subprocess.run(commands,stdin=open("auth_funcs.sql"))</code></pre>
<p>
        The following program, "demo_subprocess.py", will create the <b>.pgpass</b>
        file while the program is running. There are
        two cases. The user may already have a
        <b>~/.pgpass</b> file. If that file exists, the program
        will make a copy of that file as
        backup and write a new <b>~/.pgpass</b> file with
        the database connection information. After the subprocess is
        run, the old <b>~/.pgpass</b> file is restored from
        the backup. If there is no <b>~/.pgpass</b> file,
        the program creates that file, runs the subprocess
        and then deletes that file:
      </p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-line=""><code class="language-python">
"""
demo_subprocess.py
By leaving off the -W to prompt for a password and
by making use of .pgpass, this should work from a 
GUI program
"""
import subprocess
import os
import os.path
import shutil

filename = input("Enter name of SQL file to run: ")

commands = ["psql","-U","bob","proj2_db"]


if (os.path.exists('/home/vern/.pgpass')):
    shutil.copy('/home/vern/.pgpass','pgpass.bak')
    outfile = open('/home/vern/.pgpass','w')
    outfile.write('localhost:5432:proj2_db:bob:somepass')
    outfile.close()
    subprocess.run(commands,stdin=open(filename))
    shutil.copy('pgpass.bak','/home/vern/.pgpass')
else:
    outfile = open('/home/vern/.pgpass','w')
    os.chmod('/home/vern/.pgpass',0o600)
    outfile.write('localhost:5432:proj2_db:bob:somepass')
    outfile.close()
    subprocess.run(commands,stdin=open(filename))
    os.remove('/home/vern/.pgpass')</code></pre>
<p>
        Note that a Linux username of 'vern' is
        assumed. You will need to use the actual
        home directory as using the <b>~</b> instead of
        <b>/home/&lt;username&gt;</b> will not work with the <b>os.path.exists()</b> function
        and the <b>shutil.copy()</b> function. Also note that this
        program will prompt for the name of the
        SQL script to run.
      </p>
<h3>Steps to complete Project 2</h3>
<h4>Add the ability to obtain the SQL script filename</h4>
<p>
        Get the name of the SQL script that
        needs to be run using the QtGui.QFileDialog widget.
        Some documentation for using this widget can be
        found <a href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~takebaya/cent110/gui/gui.html" target="_blank">here</a>. You will need to
        add a QtGui.QAction menu item for initiating this
        dialog.
      </p>
<h4>Add the ability to run the SQL script</h4>
<p>
        Create a class method that will run the
        SQL script, once the filename for that script
        has been obtained. The program, "demo_subprocess.py" listed above
        can be used to help write this method.
        This method should update the tables/views that become
        available if the SQL script run creates tables/views.
      </p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
